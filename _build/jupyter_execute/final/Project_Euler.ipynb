    "\n",
    "Many of the hard problems, especially those #400 or higher, have an added layer of challenge. They can be straightforward to code in smaller cases, but then very large cases causes the compiler to get stuck, either by too long of runtime or running out of memory. For example, simpler code for <a href= \"https://projecteuler.net/problem=822\">problem #822</a> might run smoothly for case $S(10, 100)$, but then get stuck at case $S(10^4, 10^{16})$ (The case required to consider this problem complete).\n",
    "\n",
    "This happens in Matlab and in Python, and part of the challenge for hard problems is to overcome these issues. There will always be a way to make your code more efficient, either by using clever techniques in programming or taking advantage of the mathematical structure and patterns of the problem. Again using <a href= \"https://projecteuler.net/problem=822\">#822</a> as an example, one student group in Fall 2024 was able to reduce the case $S(10^4, 10^{16})$ runtime from indefinite (there was no telling when the problem would finish, it could have been hours or days) to roughly 60 seconds. My computer, which is over 5 years old, was able to corroborate this timing on their old code versus their new code."
