    "## Grading Criteria\n",
    "The grading for this topic is more open-ended.  If you decide to work on algorithmic art, either generate lots of examples within a single topic, or try out lots of examples from many topics. Be sure to describe the algorithms used and the concepts behind them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade will depend on the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Background information:__ Do you explain the steps of your code? What is the mathematics behind the images you create? What history is there to your topic, if any.\n",
    "- __Modifications:__ You will likely use code from other sites or resources to generate your first pictures. In what ways can you change this code? Which changes lead to new and interesting art?\n",
    "    - For instance, if you have code that gives you a Mandlebrot set, how can we modify this code to see other parts of the Mandebrot set? Can we change the equations to give us an entirely different plot, not a Mandlebrot set, but something similar? Can you give examples, and show the outputs of these examples?\n",
    "- __Techniques:__ Does your code incorporate other techniques from class? For example, if you use Turtle Graphics for a topic, a few lines of code can give an octagon. But if you use nested loops, can you make lots of iterations of a shape that nest within itself? More complex images with less code repetition (for instance, use a loop to draw an octagon rather than using copy-and-paste 8 times) is encouraged.\n",
    "- __Cite your references!__ Do you specify which parts of the code you changed? Make this clear, it is okay to use references as long as you are up-front about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions about your work so far, please reach out to Professor Smith."
